# Notice me Zen.py

Python code for automating a zen garden. Uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript located here https://github.com/sitver/zen-web in order to create an interactive map on a web server. That server creates a json file of the coordinates that is then convered by a python script into an array of angle coordinates that can be used by an arduino. The arduino can control a hardware arm that can draw in a sand garden.
